In the meantime, I'll get the form over to you to reduce any further delay.\nSYM: That sounds fair. Thank you.\nTRAINEE: Of course.

My name is [YOUR NAME]. How can I assist you today?\nSYM: Hi! I got a letter saying that my child is turning 16 today, and I thought I had to set up as an automated birthday gift. Every year he gets a birthday gift.\nTRAINEE: Thank you for being a sponsor and wanting to send a gift to your sponsored child. It's a wonderful way to show your care and support.\nSYM: Thank you. Do you want my account number or anything?\nTRAINEE: Yeah. May I know your sponsor number if you have it on hand?\nSYM: Yes, the number is X 1 Y 2 Z 3.\nTRAINEE: Thank you. Can you verify the first and last name on the account.\nSYM: Kim Reeves.\nTRAINEE: Alright, I have pulled up your account. And first, I would like to thank you for being part of Compassion since 2016 and for being a blessing to your two children. You do have Jim from Peru and Michael, that is from Rwanda. And with regards to the birthday gift, it looks like you haven’t setup a birthday gift here on the account. The only thing that you have set up is the automatic withdrawal for your monthly sponsorship for the birthday gift.\nSYM: Okay.\nTRAINEE: Regrettably, we don't have it here on the account. That means you didn't send a birthday gift to your child because you don't have any automatic set up of birthday gifts.\nSYM: Well, I thought it was already set up. So, if you could set it up today as an automatic gift and I can make a payment today on it. You need a card?\nTRAINEE: Let me check it here on the account. You do have here a visa card ending in 5252. Is it the one that you are using?\nSYM: Yeah, that one's good to use. Can you put it for $40? Automated birthday gift?\nTRAINEE: Yeah. Thank you so much for that. That would be $40 annually. And since we didn't receive one for today, we will be making one time birthday gift today. And then the next one would be on November 17, 2024, right?\nSYM: To do one today and the one in November?\nTRAINEE: Yes. Because it takes two to three months before it will be reflected on the account or it will be given to the child. Is it only for your child in Peru or are we going to set up for the one that is from Rwanda, for a month?\nSYM: I thought you said that one was already on automated.\nTRAINEE: It was on the automated, but you already sent one on last May 2023. You also sent one-time payment of a one-time birthday gift, but it wasn't setup on the automated payment.\nSYM: Let me just wait on that right now. When is his birthday again?\nTRAINEE: Yeah, it looks like your child's birthday, Michael is in July. Do you want to set it up today?\nSYM: Yeah, I'll do that a little bit later. I just wanted to get this one done today because I got an email that today was his birthday. I missed it. How long is it going to take for the area there to get this for him?\nTRAINEE: Yeah, it takes two to three months before they will be receiving the gift that you have sent to them.\nSYM: All right.\nTRAINEE: I'll just submit it here. So that would be the $40 pretty gift or annual pretty gift into the account.\nSYM: All right. And you have it set up as automated now, right?\nTRAINEE: Yes, that is correct.\nSYM: All right, thank you.\nTRAINEE: Everything is set now.

         "TRAINEE STARTS HERE: How did you do? View your Playback!  ",
         "SYM: Congratulations on running your first sym. Now lets see how you did. From here you can already see your Completion Time, Keyword and Click score.\nSYM: All of the playbacks for every sym you execute will always be in Playback on the left side of the screen, last tab, with the headphone icon.\nSYM: Great Job! This concludes your simulation.\nSYM: Keywords are structure words in the the conversation that are good word choices or can even be compliance words that must be said. If the sym has no agent lines you will not have a keyword score. Click score is scoring where on the visual components of the sym you navigated and clicked through during the process. Click score will only be in visual syms.\nSYM: For now, Click the Green View Playback button to see more detail on how you did.\nSYM: Starting at the top left, you can see every attempt you have completed of this sym, and the playback for each. This allows you to see how you are improving with each attempt.\nSYM: You can also see if you completed it in Practice or Test Mode, the day and time completed, and you can even click re-attempt and do it again.\nSYM: As a reminder you will not receive a sentiment score in your practice attempts, only in your test attempts, and if your sym has no agent lines, you will not have a sentiment score.\nSYM: Next you will see your Sym Accuracy Score. This measures how well your response matched the intent of what the customer was asking in the customer script line. If this is a beginner sym your score should be in the 90% range, because you would have said the script line pretty close to word for word, to learn the intent. In Intermediate and Advanced Syms, when you are formulating your own words, this score might go down, but you want to aim for the 80-90% range, so that your intent is matching the need of the customer as closely as possible. If your sym has no agent lines you will not have a sym accuracy score.\nSYM: Completion time is important because if it is taking you longer to navigate the conversation and screens, it can be an indication that you just need to practice the beginner sym more to learn the process better. It won't take long before you will know exactly what to do. Keep practicing.\nSYM: The first number in the keyword score is your score, and the second is the possible score. Keywords are structure words that are good word choices you will want to say, or they can even be compliance words you must say. Keywords guide you to the best and fastest way to customer resolution and satisfaction.\nSYM: The first number in the click score is your score, and the second is the possible score. Click scores are the places on the screens where you clicked, and it scored you if you clicked in the correct place.\nSYM: Text Field Keyword score will appear if the sym was created with keywords in the Text Fields that can be put into visual syms. A best practice is to always enter text into those fields exactly as directed because you never know if that text will be a keyword or not until you finish.\nSYM: Confidence, Concentration and Energy are your sentiment scores. These scores are calculated by the level of intent you deliver the script line in the areas of confidence, concentration and energy. These are not calculated on your voice or tone, but on how confident your level of intent is, how your focus or concentration level and how your pace or energy level of intent is. The sentiment score is calculated for the entire sym, not one part or another.\nSYM: The measurement for sentiment scores will be High, Medium or Low, and you can click the insights to learn more about what you did well, and what you can do to improve.\nSYM: The playback also allows you to listen to a recording of you executing the sym. You can click a script line below and the recording will skip to that part of the recording if you wanted to only listen to a certain part.\nSYM: If you see a dot in the recording like this, this is the Text Field Key Word Score we just talked about. This will show you if you got that word or if you missed it. As you can see I missed it because it is red, and it gave me the correct response.\nSYM: The bottom part of the playback page is the actual script. The highlighted words are the keywords. If they are green I got them. If they are red I missed them. You will also notice the KS and SA and then a number score, like 3/4 and a percent, such as 86%. These are your Keyword Scores and Sym Accuracy scores by script line. The first number in the keyword score is your score and the second is the possible score. The Sym Accuracy score tells you how you did in this line with intent compared to the customer script line you were responding to.\nSYM: This gives you the ability to see exactly in the sym where you can improve on keywords and sym accuracy. The total Sym Accuracy and Keyword scores at the top are a total of these by script line totals.\nSYM: And finally you will always see the scripted line with the keywords you said or did not say vs what you said in response. The default is to show both, but you can toggle that off if you want to just see the scripted line and the keywords you said or did not say.\nSYM: The Sym Score will equal a combined score of the different scoring options. If a sym has all three, Sym Accuracy, Keyword and Click Score, the sym score will be total of all, as one sym score. If a sym has two or only one of these scoring options, the sym score will equal the total of only the scoring options used in that sym."

I wanted to know if it's covered under my policy.\nTRAINEE: I understand. Let me check the specifics of your coverage. Just give me a moment, please.\nTRAINEE: Thank you, Ash. Let me pull up your policy information. While I do that, could you please provide me with the details of the medical procedure you're inquiring about?\nTRAINEE: Thank you for waiting, Ash. I have reviewed your policy, and I can confirm that arthroscopic meniscectomy is covered under your health insurance plan. However, it's important to note that coverage can vary based on factors such as medical necessity, network providers, and any applicable deductibles or co-payments.\nSYM: That's great to hear! Could you please provide me with some additional information? For instance, do I need a referral from my primary care physician before scheduling the surgery?\nTRAINEE: That's an excellent question, Ash. According to your policy, you do not require a referral from your primary care physician for this specific procedure. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or surgeon to ensure that the surgery is appropriate for your specific medical condition.\nSYM: I'll make sure to review my policy documents. Lastly, could you provide me with a list of in-network surgeons or facilities that perform this procedure?\nSYM: I see. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I'm also curious about the coverage limits and any out-of-pocket expenses I may incur.\nTRAINEE: Certainly, Ash. Let me go over that with you. Your policy has a coverage limit for surgical procedures, and I can see that it includes coverage for this specific surgery. As for out-of-pocket expenses, it's important to review your policy documents or contact our claims department to determine any deductibles, co-payments, or coinsurance that may apply.\nTRAINEE: Thank you for your patience, Ash. I have compiled a list of in-network surgeons and facilities that perform arthroscopic meniscectomy in your area. I will email you the list to the email address we have on file. Additionally, you can also visit our website or contact our customer service line to obtain this information.\nTRAINEE: Absolutely, Ash. I can assist you with that. Please bear with me while I access the network provider information.\nSYM: That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help. You've been very informative.\nSYM: This concludes your simulation.\nSYM: No worries.\nSYM: STEP 2 - Gather Information."

Now let’s see how you did.\nSYM: Before we get started, I want to draw your attention to the sym time length on the opening screen of each sym.\nSYM: This lets you know on average how long it should take to complete the sym.\nSYM: Take a moment to look for the “Time Elapsed” located at the top of this sym.\nSYM: As you work through syms, be sure to keep an eye on your pace so you can finish within the allotted time for the assignment.\nSYM: Let’s proceed full steam ahead!\nSYM: Reminder, here are some best practices for navigating throughout a sym. Click the arrow when you are ready to continue.\nSYM: After completing a sym, you will be directed to a screen that looks like this.\nSYM: From here you can already see your Completion Time, Keyword Score, and Click Score.\nSYM: To view more details on your sym score, click View Playback.\nSYM: This playback view provides more insight on your performance.\nSYM: You can see if you completed the sym in Practice or Test Mode, the day and time completed, and you can even click re-attempt and do it again from here.\nSYM: Here is that completion time again.\nSYM: Completion time is important because if it is taking you longer to navigate the conversation and screens, it can be an indication that you just need to practice the sym more to learn the process better.\nSYM: Let’s break down the other stats on the screen, starting with Keyword Score.\nSYM: Keywords are structure words in the conversation that are good word choices or can even be compliance words that must be said. If the sym has no agent lines, you will not have a keyword score.\nSYM: The DSC is not a scripted environment. The key words chosen throughout the syms will be ones that everyone should say.\nSYM: For example, everyone should state “Mutual of Omaha” in your call introduction.\nSYM: The first number is your keyword score, and the second is the possible score.\nSYM: In that last sym, I got 3 out of 4 keywords correct.\nSYM: To see which one I missed, I can scroll down to find it in the playback.\nSYM: Here I can see that I missed the first word, hello.\nSYM: You can click the Trainee Response to jump to that part of the recording, then click Play to listen.\nSYM: After listening to my playback, I could here that I said hello, but the microphone didn’t start picking up right away so the greeting was cut off.\nSYM: Technology is not perfect. There could also be times where it thought you said a different word. For example, application and occupation can sound similar to a computer.\nSYM: That is why the training team and your supervisors review playback on lower scoring syms.\nSYM: This allows them to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity.\nSYM: Scroll back to the top to look at the rest of the sym score.\nSYM: Let’s review Click Score next.\nSYM: Click Score is scoring where on the visual components of the sym you navigated and clicked through during the process. Click score will only be in visual syms.\nSYM: The first number is your click score, and the second is the possible score.\nSYM: In that last sym, I got 19 out of 19 clicks correct. Way to go me! That is a good indicator that I understand the process in the sym.\nSYM: Confidence, Concentration and Energy are your sentiment scores.\nSYM: These scores are calculated by the level of intent you deliver the script line in the areas of confidence, concentration and energy.\nSYM: These are not calculated on your voice or tone, but on how confident your level of intent is, your focus or concentration level, and your pace or energy level.\nSYM: The sentiment score is calculated for the entire sym, not one part or another.\nSYM: My Energy score was Medium. I can click Insights to view more.\nSYM: This is where I can find insight on how to improve that score if I were to take it again, or helpful advice for future syms.\nSYM: Next let’s look at the Sym Accuracy Score.\nSYM: This measures how well your response matched the intent of what the customer was asking in the customer script line.\nSYM: SymTrain is still working on improvements to the Sym Accuracy score, and this is being monitored by the training team at the moment.\nSYM: The final stat to look at is the Sym Score.\nSYM: This will equal a combined score of the different scoring options for that sym. If this is a beginner sym your score should be in the 80% range.\nSYM: Again, technology is not perfect. That is why the training team and supervisors will take a look at those lower scores to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity for improvement.\nSYM: Now that we’ve reviewed how to look at detailed playback after completing a sym, let’s head to the Playback page.\nSYM: The Playback page provides an overview of your sym performance for all your completed syms.\nSYM: To view the detailed playback for any sym, simply click the Actions icon.\nSYM: This concludes the simulation.\nSYM: What did we learn today?
